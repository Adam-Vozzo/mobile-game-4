Append-only iteration log. One concern per entry. Don't edit past entries.

## 0.1.0 — Iteration 1: Vertical slice

- Repo scaffolded: TypeScript strict, Vite, PixiJS 7, Howler, Workbox via
  vite-plugin-pwa, Vitest, Playwright, ESLint, Prettier.
- Docs stubbed: `DESIGN.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `PLAYTEST_NOTES.md`, `TWEAKS_FEEDBACK.jsonl`, `PERF.md`,
  `LOCKED_PARAMS.md`.
- Engine: fixed-timestep simulation @ 120Hz logic / render-uncoupled, typed
  config module (`src/config.ts`) as the single source of all tunable values.
- Renderer: PixiJS 7 WebGL stage, additive-blend Graphics for ships,
  `ParticleContainer` for thousands of particles. Bloom-like glow approximated
  via stacked half-alpha strokes (no post-process pass yet — kept cheap for v1).
- Reactive grid: 32x18 spring-mass grid, displaces toward player and away from
  explosions; rendered as lines with additive blend.
- Player: cyan vector ship, single-thumb auto-aim control scheme by default.
  Movement via left-half drag with dead-zone; auto-fire at nearest enemy.
- Bullets: object-pooled, 256 cap, simple linear motion.
- Enemy: Wanderer — drifts in a slow noise-curved path, magenta diamond
  silhouette. Object-pooled, 128 cap.
- Particles: object-pooled, 4096 cap targeting thousands on-screen during
  combat. ParticleContainer-backed. Burst on every kill.
- Score + multiplier HUD: tabular numbers, neon text-shadow glow, mult chains
  on consecutive kills within a window, decays when idle.
- PWA: manifest with landscape orientation lock, fullscreen display, theme
  color, SVG icons. Service worker via Workbox precache + runtime caching for
  static assets.
- Touch UX: prevents pinch/zoom, suppresses tap highlight, blocks
  overscroll-bounce, displays a portrait-rotation prompt on small portrait
  screens.
- Tests: Vitest unit tests for the math/RNG/pool/multiplier helpers; Playwright
  smoke test loads the app, renders for 10s, asserts no console errors and a
  non-zero score-able state.
- CI: GitHub Actions matrix runs typecheck → lint → unit → build → bundle-size
  → headless e2e on push and PR.
- Quality gates: typecheck, lint, unit, build all green at commit time;
  bundle ≤ 500 KB gzipped target tracked in `PERF.md`.
